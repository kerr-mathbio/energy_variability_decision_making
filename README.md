# Intracellular Energy Variability Modulates Cellular Decision-Making

This repository include all of the executable files used in the linked paper. This includes both Matlab (.m) and Maple (.mw) files.

In the file that the computational files are stored, create two directories named 'txt-files' and 'figures' for the outputs to be deposited. 

To check steady state stabilities, use 'steadystates_sigmoid.mw' to determine steady states for the selected parameter set and 'steadystates_point_check.m' to check the stability of each point. 

If there are any questions regarding the included files, email ryan.mathbio@gmail.com.
